Hi, i`m Matheusaacm ig, also known as coolmaster23 on some platforms, I've been coding a game on Ren'Py for a while that i'll post on itch.io probably and also
been coding a website on HTML that i'll probably put on NeoCities, I came to GitHub to track my progress in the code and because people say it's useful I guess.
I'm not expecting help from others at all to be honest because the coding i'm doing is pretty easy, but if my code is wrong in some way help would be useful.
